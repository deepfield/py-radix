py-radix is an implementation of a radix tree data structure for the storage 
and retrieval of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes.

The radix tree is the data structure most commonly used for routing table 
lookups. It efficiently stores network prefixes of varying lengths and 
allows fast lookups of containing networks.
