Fix bug(?) on Win32: getaddrinfo doesn't seem to parse IPv6 addresses

- Maybe Extend Radix methods to accept (network, mask) (contiguous masks only)

- tree.delete(RadixNode)

tree.copy()

more KNF

tree.search_all_containing(network) -> [ network, network ] (sorted by prefix)
(use search_best2 internally)

tree.search_containing(network) -> RadixNode or None
 Find the prefix containing 'network', not including an exact match. 

tree.num_prefixes()

dict-like interface:
	tree[addr] = user_object

"blur" prefix - reduce masklen
